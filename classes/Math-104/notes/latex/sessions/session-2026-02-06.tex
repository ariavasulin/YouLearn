\begin{summarybox}
\textbf{Session Summary} \\
\textbf{Date:} February 6, 2026 \\
\textbf{Mode:} Review (\texttt{/Rev}) \\
\textbf{Duration:} 45 minutes \\
\textbf{Topics:} Compactness, Heine-Borel theorem, perfect sets
\end{summarybox}

\textbf{What we covered:}
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item Reviewed the definition of \defn{compactness} and open covers from Lecture 5
    \item Worked through why $[0,1]$ is compact but $(0,1)$ is not
    \item Practiced applying the Heine-Borel theorem to identify compact subsets of $\R^n$
    \item Discussed the relationship between compactness, closedness, and boundedness
    \item Reviewed the Cantor set as an example of a perfect set
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Areas for further review:}
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item Sequential compactness vs.\ open-cover compactness (Lecture 5, \S5.1)
    \item Proof that compact subsets of Hausdorff spaces are closed (Theorem 2.34)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Next session:} Work through HW 2, Problem 27 (compactness argument).
