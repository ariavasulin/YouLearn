# Set Theory

Def  a function f: A-> B is a 'relation' R subset A x B s.t. fro all x in A exists! y in B s.t. (x,y) in R (this is often denoted f(x)). A is called the domain of f B is the codomain / range

Note that not all relations are functions . If E subset A f(E) = {f(x)| x in E} called the image of E <fill in preimage>. if f(A) = B then f is 'surjective'  or onto <fill in 1-1/ injective def>. 

## Equiv. rleation

* Reflexivity identity
* Symmetry f: A->B then we have f^-1: B-> A
* Transitivity: A->B->C with f:A->B, g:B->C

Def: We can say that A and B have the same `cardinality` if f: A->B is 1-1 and onto.

Def: Let [n]= {1,2,3..., n} we say that:

1) A is finite id exists n s.t. A~[n]
2)  infinite  not finite
3) countable if A~N
